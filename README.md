# Job Search Application

This project demonstrates how to set up Elasticsearch with Docker, populate it with sample job data, and create a React application to search and display jobs using Reactivesearch.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node.js and npm

## Setup and Run Elasticsearch

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   Start Elasticsearch with Docker:
   ```

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Populate Elasticsearch with Sample Data
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the script to populate data:

bash
Copy code
node populate_es.js
Run the React Application
Navigate to the React application directory:

bash
Copy code
cd job-search-app
Install React dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Your job search application should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000, connected to your Elasticsearch instance.

Summary of Steps
Start Elasticsearch:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Populate Elasticsearch with data:

bash
Copy code
npm install
node populate_es.js
Run the React application:

bash
Copy code
cd job-search-app
npm install
npm start
That's it! You should now have a fully functional job search application running locally.
